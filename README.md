# Starbucks-Capstone-Project-DSND

## 1.Installation
- Python versions 3.*.
- Libraries used:
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - Scikit learn
    
## 2.Project Motivation
This project is part of my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree(DSND). My objective was to build a model that can predict accurately how will the customers respond to an offer? The aim was to get a model that is able to predict whther a given customer will complete  a recieved offer or just view it.

## 3.File Descriptions
This repository includes one notebook and an HTML version of that notebook. The data were not included since Udacity mentioned that including the dataset in the repository in not requiered as long as the datasets used are one of the suggested datasets to work on. There is a full explanation about the structure of the dataframes within the notebook. Markdown cells and comments have been used all over the notebook to assist in undersatanding the coding and analysis parts.

## 4.Results
From the analysis done through the project, I got the following insights:
 get the following insights:
- Customers income ranges from 30,000 and 120,000 with most of the customers’ incomes fall between 50,000 and 75,0000.
- According to the available data, There are three ‘gender’ categories into which the customers falls in ( M, F and O). Keeping in our mind the above observation that there are 2175 missing values, Male Customers (8484 men) are more than Female Customers(6129 women) with 57% of customers are Males compared to 41% Females. However, there are 212 customers chose “O” as their gender. 
- The most common offer type among all age groups is the BOGO , followed by the Discount Offers. Whereas, the least common offer to be sent is the informational offers. I believe that BOGO offers are more attractive compared to other offers provided by Starbucks.
- Customers with High income (Above 90,000) are mostly female customers. Whereas, Average Income(30,000 - 60,000) customers are mostly males.
- Males and Females are pretty close when it comes to the time spent to complete an offer. Both males and females take about 17 days to da so.
- 2017 was the best year for Starbucks in terms of the number of new members. Around %38 of all the customers on our dataset regiseterd as members on this specific year.
- Both genders like BOGO and Discount offers and they have the same reaction toward Informational offers, they both seem to be not interested to it.
- The mean time it takes a customer to complete an offer is less than 16 days (372 hours).
- Females completed around 75% of the offers they viewed, it is 16% more than males who just completed 58% of the offers they viewed. Feamles seems to be convinced by the promotion easier than males.

The findings are discussed in details throughthe notebook. and a blog explaining the critical parts of this project can be found [Here](Link will be added once I publish the blog , hopefully within a few hours)
